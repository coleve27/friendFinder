# Nap Finder

Nap Finder will tell you how long to nap based on 10 tired-ness related survey questions. The user responds to questions with values from 1 to 5. When the survey is submitted, the user will receive a recommended nap length and a cute cat picture. The application is implemented using Node and Express server on the back end and a Bootstrap CSS Framework
